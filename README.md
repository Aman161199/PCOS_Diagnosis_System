For this project, I have developed a predictive system by comparing 5 different Machine Learning models accuracy and finding the most efficient model and using it for a more precise diagnosis.

**NOTE:** Github doesnâ€™t render iframes at the moment. Plotly Charts present in the code file donot show up in github. Click on [PCOS Diagnosis System](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/smritig19/PCOS_Diagnosis_System/blob/main/PCOS%20Diagnosis%20System.ipynb) to view the plotly interactive graphs using nbviewer.
